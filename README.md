This repository will be yet another house for the infamouse Gang of Four Design patterns.

I got inspired to set this up after looking at the work by Prem Aseem Jain.
That repo (https://github.com/premaseem/DesignPatternsJava9) is licensed as GPL v3.
All diagrams and many code examples are his work. Hence this repository has been licenced as GPL v3.
